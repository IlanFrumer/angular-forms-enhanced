Angular forms enhanced !
========================

Documentation - work in progress.

Currently, the core $prisitine state only indicates that the user has not interacted with the control yet.

#### We need a way of:
* Save the original values.
* Revert to the original values, and change back to pristine state.
* Inform parent forms when child control get back to pristine state.

This module changes the way of how $pristine works.
